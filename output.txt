But on his 11th birthday, he learns he's a powerful wizard—with a place waiting for him at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As he learns to harness his newfound powers with the help of the school's kindly headmaster, Harry uncovers the truth about his parents' deaths—and about the villain who's to blame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |    219.332 | /wuMc08IPKEatf9rnMNXvIDxqP4W.jpg | 2001-11-16   | Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone                                  | f     |        7.915 |      25554

Harry suspects perils may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemorts defenses and to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Even as the decisive showdown looms, romance blossoms for Harry, Ron, Hermione and their classmates. Love is in the air, but danger lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.                            |    136.821 | /z7uo9zmQdQwU5ZJHFpv2Upl30i1.jpg | 2009-07-15   | Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince                                    | f     |        7.695 |      18235
